Hello {{ caller.nickName }},

{% endif %}
I am a Zpark bot (see: https://knightjoel.github.io/zpark).  I relay alerts from a Zabbix (https://www.zabbix.com/product) server to Spark and I allow certain people to query information from Zabbix by sending me commands via Spark message.

You can send these commands:
- show issues - Show active Zabbix issues
- show status - Show Zabbix server stats (same as what's shown in the Zabbix UI)

Note:
- In a group space, you need to get my attention by @-mentioning me in your message.
- I only respond to commands received from a list of trusted users (and since I'm responding to you now, that means you are on the list).
{% if zpark_contact_info is not none %}

My caretaker is {{ zpark_contact_info }}.
